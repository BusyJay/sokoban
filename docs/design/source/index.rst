Welcome to sokoban's documentation!
===================================

Sokoban is a project that aims to ease people's pain of maintaining documentaions when you have your documentation sources and display different places.

One Common situation is that when you create a project and happy making progresses, your employer want you to push your documentations to confluence or wikimedia. Then you can just still code your project and then write documentation to other server manuely. Or you can use sokoban to do all the messy for you and make you stay in project itself.

Sokoban will automatically check your project, and will update documentations to the specified server when changes detected.
